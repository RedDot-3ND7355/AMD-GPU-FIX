## Having issues after installing a (new) gpu in your system?

Then this is the tool for you!

Here's a list of symptoms caused by MPO (a feature added by Microsoft a few years back):
- Stutters when tabbing out of games (multitasking)
- Driver crashes/System hangs when using hardware accelerated browsers
- Driver crashes/System hangs when trying to stream
- Anything fullscreen would cause huge stutters and can lead to crashes and hangs
- Screen flickering nonstop

List of GPU affected by MPO as reported by users:
- NVIDIA RTX 40 Series
- NVIDIA RTX 30 Series
- NVIDIA RTX 20 Series
- NVIDIA GTX 1600 Series
- AMD RX 5000 Series
- AMD RX 6000 Series
- AMD RX 7000 Series
- And maybe more!

Why did I make this tool?

Because I was also plagued by these issues and found out about MPO 2 weeks after enduring pure torture of having
a decent pc not being able to do jacksh**t. So I decided to help everyone out by making the process a lot easier.
I know that NVIDIA released Reg files to disable/restore MPO, but I wanted to make a user friendly experience.
Also because I got time on my hand during winter x')
